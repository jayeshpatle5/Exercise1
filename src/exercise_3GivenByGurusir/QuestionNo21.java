//	21.	Difference between CSS selector and xpath? which one you will prefer?
	
//	The format of xpath is //tagname[@attribute='value'] while the format of css selector is tagname[attribute='value'].
//
//	We can traverse both forward and backward in DOM, i.e we can move from parent to child 
//	element and also from child to the parent element with xpath.
//	However for css, we can only traverse from parent to child and not vice-versa.
//
//	In terms of performance, css is better and faster, while xpath is on 
//	a slower side. An xpath can be of two types â€“ absolute which starts from 
//	the root node and relative does not require to be started from the root.
