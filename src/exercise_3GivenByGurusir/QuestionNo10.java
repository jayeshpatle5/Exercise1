	// 10.	What is Agile scrum, Sprint?
	
	
	
//	      What is the Agile methodology?
	
//	Ans:-	The Agile methodology is a project management 
//			approach that involves breaking the project into phases and emphasizes 
//			continuous collaboration and improvement. 
//			Teams follow a cycle of planning, executing, and evaluating.
	
//	       What is scrum?
	
//	Ans:- 	Scrum is an agile project management framework 
//			that helps teams structure and manage their work through a
//			set of values, principles, and practices. Much like a rugby 			
//			team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, 
//			scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, 
//			self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect
//			on their wins and losses to continuously improve.
	
	
//	        What are sprints?
	
//	ans :-	A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when
//			a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. 
//			Sprints are at the very heart of scrum and agile methodologies,
//			and getting sprints right will help your agile team ship better
//			software with fewer headaches. 
	
//	Agile is a philosophy, whereas Scrum is a type of Agile methodology
//	Scrum is broken down into shorter sprints and smaller deliverables,
//	while in Agile everything is delivered at the end of the project
//	Agile involves members from various cross-functional teams, while 
//	a Scrum project team includes specific roles, such as the Scrum Master and Product Owner
